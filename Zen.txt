1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2.
3.Simple is better than complex.
4.Complex is better than complicated.
5.Flat is better than nested.
6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
11.Errors should never pass silently.
13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it
16.Although never is often better than *right* now.
